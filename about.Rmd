## Introduction

I'm a strategy consultant at Rainmakers CSI and a data science enthusiast.

Before I became a big fan of R, I learnt Excel VBA as a  "first language" as I discovered the potential and power of automating repetitive processes with programming. I then came across R and everything that comes with it: a highly active and collaborative community, an incredible range of powerful packages, and the good analysis practice it encourages.
