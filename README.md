This is the repository used for hosting my personal website https://martinctc.github.io.

This website was built using RMarkdown, but the blog sub-page (https://martinctc.github.io/blog/) makes use of both Jekyll (a static HTML generator) and RMarkdown.

Please check out https://github.com/privefl/rmarkdown-website-template for the original template used to build this site.
