## My packages

I've authored four R packages, which are all available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/martinctc):

* [surveytoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/surveytoolbox)
* [tstoolbox](https://www.github.com/martinctc/tstoolbox)
* [rwa](https://www.github.com/martinctc/rwa)
* [textworks](https://www.github.com/martinctc/textworks)

These packages were to some extent "by-products" of the analysis that I've been doing for the last couple of years, which I decided would have greater value developed into packages. If you have any comments or questions about these packages, please get in touch - any feedback would be valuable!

## Blogs

On this same site you can find my [blog](https://martinctc.github.io/blog), where I write about things related to #rstats and data science. I contribute my blogs to [r-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org), which you can find as an example two of my blogs featured in the [2019 Week 17 update](https://rweekly.org/2019-17.html) on R Weekly.
